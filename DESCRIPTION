Description: We provide functions to perform taxometric analyses. This package contains 46 functions, but only 5 should be called directly by users. CheckData() should be run prior to any taxometric analysis to ensure that the data are appropriate for taxometric analysis. RunTaxometrics() performs taxometric analyses for a sample of data. RunCCFIProfile() performs a series of taxometric analyses to generate a CCFI profile. CreateData() generates a sample of categorical or dimensional data. ClassifyCases() assigns cases to groups using the base-rate classification method.
